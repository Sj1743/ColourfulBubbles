HERE YOU WILL CREATE A CLASS BUBBLE USING THE ELLIPSE COMMAND AND THEN GIVE A RANDOM VELOCITY EQUATION TO RANDOMLY MOVE THE BUBBLES 
AND WHILE MOVEMENT IF IT TOUCHES EACH OTHER THEN THE COLOUR WILL CHANGE RANDOMLY . 
YOU WILL CREATE 2 BUBBLES BY CALLING THE CLASS BUBBLE IN THE SKETCH.JS IN FUNCTION SETUP AND DISPLAY THEM IN THE FUNCTION DRAW. 
ALSO USE THE COLOR COMMAND TO RANDOMLY GENERATE THE COLOURS.
